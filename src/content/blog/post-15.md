## What is Bicing Barcelona?

Bicing Barcelona is a bicycle rental service introduced in 2007 in the city of Barcelona, designed to provide residents and visitors with a sustainable and practical way to get around the city. The system allows users to rent bicycles from various strategic points across Barcelona, making this eco-friendly mode of transportation more accessible.

To use Bicing Barcelona, users must register on the platform and select the type of bicycle they wish to rent. The service offers different rental options tailored to each user's needs, whether for short trips or extended use. Bicing Barcelona contributes to sustainable mobility in the city by reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthy lifestyle among its users.

To ensure a better experience and more efficient service operation, it is essential to accurately predict the availability of bikes and docking spaces.

## The project

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model to Predict the percentage of free docks at Bicing stations in Barcelona given the historical data of each station, furthermore we leveraged other geographical and temporal data, 

To achieve this goal we followed the next steps:
